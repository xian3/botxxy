say theres 8 people in a channel. then 6 people would like to play, so they use the command to get in.
then those six people are assigned a number randomly like 0-5. then the gun starts at 0.
then they can use one of two commands !spinthebarrel or !pullthetrigger.
if they want to spin the barrel it only works once if they try to use it twice.
or they can just pull the trigger without spinning. then it goes onto the next person in line.
but the gun would work as having a bullet randomly in 0-5 on the chamber.
the bot would spin the barrel on the beginning of the game before anyones turn.
the bullet say, it gets chamber 2 of the barrel (0-5) and player 1 gets the gun after the bot spun and its on chamber 0.
he !pullstrigger. lives. it goes to the next person and the chamber is at 1. they dont spin the barrel and just !pulltrigger.
they live and pass it on but now the chamber is at 2. the third player
then we can maybe code it to keep remaining players and put in a new bullet at a random chamber.
and spin the barrel and pass it to the next person in line.
